## 📌 Introduction

The following set of Python exercises, consisting of data types, loops, conditions, functions, encryption, and even a simple Hangman game, are featured in this repository to support learners with focusing on fundamental programming skills and basic principles. Participants may improve and develop their coding skills during each activity, which emphasises various elements of Python programming.

## 📝 Exercises Overview

### 📌 Exercise 1: Python Data types

- Construction (and output) of lists, tuples, dictionaries, sets and strings.

### 📌 Exercise 2: Conditions

- Figuring out if the value is zero, positive, or negative.
- Find out when the string starts off with a vowel or else a consonant.
- Testing for the match of two numbers.

### 📌  Exercise 3: Loops

- Applying loops, even numbers, and the Fibonacci number

### 📌 Exercise 4: Functions

- Writing functions consists of adding, identifying the largest possible number, and the text's vowels.

### 📌 Exercise 5: Password Strength Checker

- The verification of a password comprised of capital and lowercase letters, special characters, and length characters.

### 📌 Exercise 6: Caesar Cipher

- Integrating the Caesar Cypher technique to support encryption and decryption.

### 📌 Exercise 7: Hangman Game

- A relatively straightforward example of a traditional word-guessing game with just a few possible answers.

## 🚀 Installation and Usage

### ✅ Prerequisites

- Python 3.x installed on your system.

- Code editor (VS Code, PyCharm) or terminal
